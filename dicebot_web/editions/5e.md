Information:
The information section contains information about your character such as a description and features
Any text blocks can be stored here for any reason
It is recommended that you prefix information names with something like `Feature: ` to group them

Variables:
The variables section hold the numeric attributes of your character such as strength or proficiency bonus
Some defaults have been filled in, be sure to change them to reflect your character
Variables can only have whole number values, anything else will cause an error

Rolls:
The rolls section stores dice calculations to be used by the bot
These rolls can use variables so that stored rolls don't have to change when your stats do
The special `!` operator calculates the modifier for a stat, see the examples or bot help for more info

Some defaults are included, notably all of the skills and saves are included with no proficiencies
To add proficiency to a roll simply add `+prof` to the end of the skill or save
`+prof//2` can be used to add half proficiency (rounded down) or `+prof*2` for double proficiency

Additionally, rolls can be used for more than just dice rolling, any calculated value can be stored
e.x. `8+!int+prof` gives the spell save DC for a wizard, or `14+(!dex<2)` gives your AC in scale mail

Resources:
Resources track any limited use skills or resources like HP and spell slots
`long rest` resources recover during a long rest
`short rest` resources recover during a short or long rest
`other rest` resources must be recovered manually (magic item uses often go here)
Resources can go above max or below 0, but must be whole number values

Spells:
The spell section contains information about spells
Cantrips are considered level 0

Inventory:
The inventory section contains information about the items you carry
This includes their quantity and an optional description
